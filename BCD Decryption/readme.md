# Project:BCD Decryption

## Requirementsï¼š 
1. The program requires the user to input a positive 3-digit number through the keyboard each time and then outputs the number in digit reverse order. Note: when the input number contains a terminating 0, the output should not have a leading 0. For example, if 700 is the input, the output should be 7.
2. Input format: each test is a 3-digit number as well as a positive integer. 
3. utput format: output number in digit reverse order.

### For example: 
Input:
```
123
```
Output:
```
321
```
